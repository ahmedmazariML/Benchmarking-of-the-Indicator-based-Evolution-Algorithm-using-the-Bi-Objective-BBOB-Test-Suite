# Benchmarking-of-the-Indicator-based-Evolution-Algorithm-using-the-Bi-Objective-BBOB-Test-Suite

This project set as objectives to study, implement and bench- mark the Indicator Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) using 
the Comparing Continuous Optimizer (COCO) plat- form. IBEA uses as performance measure for the optimiza- tion goal an 
indicator of the relative quality of two sets of so- lution vectors with respect to the Pareto front. Our groupâ€™s focus 
was on the epsilon indicator. The report is outlined as follows: first we present the specificity of the indicator used, 
as well as the thought process behind the evolution strat- egy. Then we describe our experimental methodology along with 
the results obtained for different parametrizations and variation operators. Finally, those results are discussed and compared 
with related multi-objective approaches.
